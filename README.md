[Action-Adventure Template](https://asgith.github.io/game-boy-action-adventure-template-page) is a Game Boy project, that would be used as a starting point, in future projects. Whenever I create a project, I tend to start from scratch. Having this template would give me a head start and my goal with is template is to make it easy/modular to build from it.

Latest Update:

* April 22nd, 2021
  - Issue with collision. Player in certain directions would clip into tile, causing issues being able to move.

## Miscellaneous

Tools used:

* Backgrounds/Sprites/Tiles - [Game Boy Map Builder & Game Boy Tile Designer](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/GBTD_GBMB)

* Developer Kit - [Game Boy Development Kit](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020)

* Emulator - [BGB GameBoy Emulator](http://bgb.bircd.org/)

## To Run it

To get it up and running, you'll need to have a emulator that can run Game Boy games. My preference is to use [BGB GameBoy Emulator](http://bgb.bircd.org/)

Once you have an emulator of choice, then:

* Download the .gb file from the [releases section](https://github.com/ASGitH/game-Boy-Action-Adventure-Template/releases/tag/build-00).

* Load up the .gb file and have fun!
